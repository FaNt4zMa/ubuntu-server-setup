# Storage Configuration

Follow these steps to configure and mount a new storage drive on Ubuntu.

## Partitioning a New Drive

### 1. Identify the New Drive  
List all available drives to find the new one (e.g., `/dev/sdb`):
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
**Note:** If the drive is larger than **2TB**, use **GPT** instead of MBR.
### 2. Partition the Drive
Use `fdisk` for MBR or `gdisk` for GPT to create a partition.

**MBR Partition (for drives under 2TB)**
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```
* Type `n` to create a new partition.
* Type `p` for a primary partition.
* Accept the default values for partition size.
* Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

**GPT Partition (for drives over 2TB)**
```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/sdb
```
* Type `o` to create a new GPT partition table.
* Type `n` to create a new partition.
* Accept default values to use the entire disk.
* Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

## Formatting the Partition
Format the partition to ext4 (replace `/dev/sdb1` with the actual partition name):
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

## Mounting the Drive
### 1. Create a Mount Point
Choose a directory where the drive will be mounted:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/newdrive
```
### 2. Mount the Drive Temporarily
To verify the setup before making it permanent:
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdrive
```
### 3. Auto-Mount on Boot (Persistent Mount)
**Find the Driveâ€™s UUID**
```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
```
Copy the UUID from the output.

**Edit /etc/fstab to Make the Mount Persistent**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Add this line at the end (replace `your-uuid-here` with the actual UUID):
```bash
UUID=your-uuid-here /mnt/newdrive ext4 defaults 0 2
```
**Apply and Verify the Mount**
```bash
sudo mount -a
df -h
```

## Partitioning an Old Drive with Existing Partitions

### 1. Identify the Drive
First, identify the correct drive and its existing partitions using the `lsblk` command:
```bash
lsblk
```
This will display a list of all drives and their partitions. Look for your drive and note down the partition names (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/sdb2`).

### 2. Unmount the Partitions (if necessary)
If any of the partitions are mounted, unmount them before proceeding:
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdX2
```
Replace `sdX1` and `sdX2` with the appropriate partition identifiers for your drive.

### 3. Delete the Existing Partitions
You can use `fdisk` or `parted` to delete the existing partitions and create new ones.

Using `fdisk`:
Start `fdisk` on your drive:
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
```
* Press `p` to print the partition table (this step is optional but recommended for confirmation).

* Press `d` to delete a partition. It will ask for the partition number to delete. Repeat this for each partition you want to remove.

* After deleting the partitions, press `n` to create a new partition. Select "primary" and use the entire disk space.

* Press `w` to write the changes and exit `fdisk`.

### 4. Format the New Partition
Now, format the new partition to `ext4`:
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1
```
This command will format the partition as `ext4`. Ensure you replace `/dev/sdX1` with the actual partition name.

### 5. Follow Mounting Instructions
Once the partition is created and formatted, proceed with the mounting instructions outlined in the [Mounting the Drive](#mounting-the-drive) section of this guide to set up the partition for use.

## Reducing Filesystem Overhead (Optional)
By default, ext4 reserves 5% of the filesystem for the root user, which helps prevent system failures when storage is full. You can reduce this to 1% (useful for large storage drives):
```bash
sudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sdb1
```
